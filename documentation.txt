we install virtual environment 
due to virtual env a new isolated environment is made where all the file is installed locally not globally which means we can use different package version in our diffrent projects

->pip install virtualenv        ->to install venv
->virtualenv virtualenvname     ->to make virtual env
->source virtialenvname/bin/activate  ->activate venv
->deactivate       ->deactivate venv
->rm -r venvname   ->to delet venv
